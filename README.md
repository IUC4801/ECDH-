This project uses the concept of hybrid encryption, where AES and ECDH encryption algorithm are used for securing online transaction via double encryption. This is used in both client and server side. Here, the user will enter his/her credit/debit card number, CVV and expiry date of the card. This information will be encrypted and then will further be passed on to the bank server and will be decrypted for verification purposes.
